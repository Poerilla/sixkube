## Setting our Rails app

Install ruby using rbenv

`rbenv install 2.5.1`

If you do not use rbenv install using rvm

`rvm install 2.5.1
rvm use 2.5.1 --default
ruby -v`

If you neither have rvm or rbenv it is recommended that you use them as they make switching ruby versions simpler than having to install ruby from source. For a quick and easy tutorial on setting up ruby and Rails appls please follow [this](https://www.google.com) link.

The last step is to install Bundler

`gem install bundler`

Now we make sure all dependencies in your Gemfile are available to your application.

`bundle install`
